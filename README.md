JavaScript, Bootstrap, and UFOs

## Project Overview

I have been tasked with assisting Dana, a Data Journalist, with creating an aesthetically appealing and dynamic webpage to visualize UFO sighting data from a JavaScript file containing hundreds of records.  After using basic HTML to build the webpage, I created a table to hold the data and display it in a clean manner.  The final version of the JavaScript application ([app.js](https://github.com/agregorash/UFOs/blob/main/static/js/app.js)) I created allows the user to dynamically filter the records with up to 5 different search criteria so they can find and compare the phenomena.

## Resources
- Data Source: [data.js](https://github.com/agregorash/UFOs/blob/main/static/js/data.js)
- Software/ Tools: JavaScript, Visual Studio Code, Bootstrap, CSS

## Webpage Results

The home screen of the webpage includes a jumbo-header with a sci-fi background image, as well as two columns that contain a thought provoking header and two contradicting view points, and finally a call to action to have the user analyze the provided data to formulate or support their own opinion.

### Filter and Table Default Display

The bottom portion of the webpage is laid out in a similar fashon with the Filter Search input boxes on the left-hand side and the Data Table, which contains headings for each of the search criteria in the Filter Search bar, on the right hand side.

### Single Filter Display

Users can filter UFO sightings baded off the date...

### Multiple Filter Display

Or by any number or combination of the 5 filters.


## Mission-To-Mars Summary

I, along with Dana's assistance, have accomplished the mission of creating an aesthetically pleasing and dynamic webpage to display our UFO sightings data, however improvements can always be made.  A drawback of the new design, which replaced the filter button with script that pulls any new data from the filter input boxes automatically, is that it takes away some user control in the interaction with the filters.  Some users may prefer the interaction of clicking a button in order to filter the results.  My recommendations for further developing this webpage would be to first format the Date filter as all the other filter bars are, with the text "Enter Date" above the actual input box.  This would help continue the flow of the webpage making it more aesthetically pleasing.  My second recommendation would be to add upvote and downvote buttons to each record, so that the most popular and intriguing sightings would be displayed at the top of the page in descending order as opposed to having them ordered based off date.  This would increase the user interaction experience and make the webpage even more dynamic.
